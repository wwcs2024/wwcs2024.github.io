The application form will be available soon.

We aim to create an inclusive, diverse, sociable, and motivated group of young researchers. Excellent applicants with no previous experiences with complexity research will also be considered. In the last years 20-30% of applicants were invited to attend the Winter Workshop.

## Registration

The workshop registration fee includes:
- Accommodation from Sunday to Friday (5 nights)
- Breakfast at accommodation
- Lunch, coffee breaks, and dinners
- Social activity
- Transport from Barcelona to the venue

The workshop will exclusively be an onsite event. In case of restrictions due to pandemics, we will cancel the event.

## Accommodation

We will provide you with shared rooms at [Corriol](https://www.corriolserveis.com/) in the Catalan Pyrenees. 

<!---
We will split the rooms based on gender. In case you prefer to have a single room, please send us an email to [wwcs2024@gmail.com](mailto:wwcs2024@gmail.com).


## Travel Grant

We hope to enable all students independent of financial means to attend the winter school. Therefore, we have reserved a limited budget for travel grants. Please send us an email with a motivation (200 words) and a list of needed funds to our email address [wwcs2024@gmail.com](mailto:wwcs2024@gmail.com). With the acceptance letter, we will notify you with how much money we can support you. In case the required budget exceeds the available funds, we might not be able to cover all your needed costs.
